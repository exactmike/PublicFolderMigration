LocalServerVersionNotSupported = You cannot execute this script from your local Exchange server: "{0}". This script can only be executed from Exchange 2007 Management Shell and above.
ForceParameterRequired = You are about to remove ALL mail-enabled public folders from Exchange Online Active Directory. Only proceed if you do not have any users on Exchange Online already using mail-enabled public folders. Also, make sure your local Exchange deployment doesn't have any mail-enabled public folders by running Get-MailPublicFolder. You can bypass this warning by running the script using the -Force parameter.
SystemFoldersSkipped = The following {0} mail-enabled public folder(s) will not be synced as they are linked to system public folders. These folders are not applicable for Exchange Online.
UnableToDetectSystemMailPublicFolders = The script is unable to determine a list of system public folders while the local public folder deployment is locked for migration. This may cause some mail-enabled system public folders to be synced to Exchange Online Active Directory and cause Public Folder migration to fail. If that happens, you can run "Set-MailPublicFolder -IgnoreMissingFolderLink:$true" for each AD object that is a system folder and resume the migration. Note that these system folders don't need to be mail-enabled on Exchange 2013 or later, so it is completely safe to ignore errors reported while mail-enabling them during migration.
